# Project Installation Guide

This guide will walk you through the necessary steps to set up and configure your project. Please follow these instructions carefully to ensure a smooth installation process.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Version control system
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Containerization platform, with this setup environment:
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime environment
  - [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) - PHP dependency manager
  - [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - Node.js package manager

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Project**:

   Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine using Git. Open your terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

   Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of your project's Git repository.

2. **Configure the Environment**:

   Navigate to the project directory and locate the `.env` file. You will need to configure this file with your specific environment settings, such as database credentials and other project-specific configuration.

3. **Install PHP Dependencies**:

   With Docker running and your project directory as the working directory, execute the following command to install PHP dependencies using Composer:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

   This command will pull and install the required PHP packages for your project.

4. **Install JavaScript Dependencies**:

   To install JavaScript dependencies, run the following command in the same Docker environment:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command will fetch and install all necessary JavaScript libraries and packages.
